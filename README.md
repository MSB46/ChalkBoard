### Sitemap by Elvis:
After finishing the sitemap for this project I learned new syntax for adding images, differents headers, links, and lists to a Markdown file.
It was a bit challenging at first because for some reason it did not want to upload local images, so I then found about [this](https://gist.github.com/vinkla/dca76249ba6b73c5dd66a4e986df4c8d) website that taught me how to upload images to a Markdown file. It is useful to learn about editing a Markdown file because in almost any GitHub project the READ.md file is crucial because it explains your project "in a nutshell." And adding visuals, links, and more features to explain your project helps anyone to understand what it is about. I wil definelty put it in practice on my future personal web projects because it could help me to land interships, or even attract potential clients with a great presentation about my personal web projects. And this sitemap will give a broad idea to my partner and me about what pages we should include in our project, along the wireframes it will be a great guide to follow.

### Wireframe by Michael:
By the time I finished the wireframe, I realized how difficult it can be to design a website if you don't have a blueprint for what you're trying to make. I also learned that looking at other wireframes and other websites that I'm familiar with is a great way to come up with new ideas. When I started with the wireframe, it took me a little less than two hours to create it the first time. However, I later realized that my wireframe was sloppy and more complex than it should be which is why I decided to start from scratch, taking the ideas I liked from the first draft. Doing this made me understand another concept which is the importance of making multiple drafts. It's extremely helpful to create several versions of a wireframe so that you can better visualize how you want your end product to look like. As a result, I was able to create a wireframe that I'm satisfied with while having an idea on what to do next.
